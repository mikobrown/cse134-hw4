## Site Changes

I changed the alt text for all the images in my site to be more descriptive and avoid abbreviating



## Third Party JS

I added google analytics to my site by inserting code after head of index.html

I added this code so that I can track how many users visit my site and how the users interact with my site so I can see what I may need to improve in terms of user experience.
